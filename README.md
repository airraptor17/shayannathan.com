This is my personal website hosted on Github, which I made to gain more experience with Jekyll and Github while also making a site for myself. The template was shared to me by my buddy [Sharan Jhangiani](https://sharanjhangiani.com/). The base template was all made by [Katherine Huang](http://katmh.com/), and you can fork this open source Jekyll theme I used here: [Point Theme](https://github.com/katavie/point-theme).
